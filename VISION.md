## Background

The recent GameStop short squeeze and the ensuing retail investor vs. hedge fund narrative has highlighted the need for "we the people" to develop tools to defend our income in the face of ever growing wealth inequality. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, this has only been made worse. Governments around the world have flooded the economy with money allowing the richest and most affluent to get richer while they promise to 'trickle down' their gains.  We all know this does not work.

We can do better... we must do better. The benefits of capitalism can be shared with more people.  We can inform individuals about buying opportunities and who are good corporate citizens to allow people to design and build their own financial future. Every little bit of capital an individual can amass should be able to return gains that similar to those the richest recieve.  If we learn to share that we 'just like the stock' with each other, we can all decide for ourselves what we want to do next.

To achieve this, we must break the asymetic nature of this impasse.  Hedge funds and the wealthy elite have data and information at their disposal that allows them to stay one step ahead of the rest of us.  They can trade before the news or position to short and call their way to massive profits. Without similar information, the regular everyday investor is left to hope, pray, and have luck that inflation and salary stagnation will not push them further behind.

This can end now. We have seen the power when we come together and share information. We can win as much as the next hedge fund.

## Vision

Using Open Source and Free Software development priciples, we can develop the software and systems required for all of us to learn what we should do next.  We can build data pipelines to curate data. We can build simplified tools to allow individuals to make decisions.  We can all contribute our resources and effort to make the world a better place for all of us-- we can level the playing field.

## What is Needed?

We will need to find a team of creative leaders able to take on a variety of aspects of a project this big. We must expand on this vision to understand what the community needs.  As that takes shape, we will need to direct a number of individuals towards common goals-- building a standardized framework for processing disparate financial and non-financial information streams into a series of analytical and decision support tools to help everyday people keep their hard earned wealth.

Along the way we will likely need hard investment from like minded individuals; social entrepreneurs and wealthy alturistic people. We must find a way to accept their support without compromising the vision.

We will face the risk that the hedge funds that continually fleece the general hard working public's retirement funds will use the tools we build against us. We must face this reality and remain steadfast in our commitment to allow *all* to gain.  If they make less, and we make more, we'll all be better in the end.

This is a vision... a vision to enable the many to achieve gains at the expense of the few.
